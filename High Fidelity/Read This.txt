I re-designed TED mobile application Interface

This was HCI project that concentrates on upgrading the UI of an app to be more consistent and friendly to the user

If you had "JustInMind" software you can take a look at the prototype to see the new UI comes alive as it has some cool animations.

*if you have time you can compare it with the real application to see the difference*
